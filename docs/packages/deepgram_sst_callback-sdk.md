Pre-Recorded Audio Transcription
An overview of the Deepgram Python SDK and Deepgram speech-to-text pre-recorded.

Suggest Edits
The Deepgram Pre-Recorded Clients allows you to request transcripts for pre-recorded audio. To request a transcript for a pre-recorded particular audio file, you'll use one of the following functions depending on your audio source:

transcribe_file
transcribe_url
📘
This SDK supports both the Threaded and Async/Await Clients as described in the Threaded and Async IO Task Support section. The code blocks contain a tab for Threaded and Async to show examples for prerecorded versus async prerecorded, respectively. The difference between Threaded and Async is subtle.

Pre-recorded Transcription Parameters
Parameter	Type	Description
source	Buffer, Url	Provides the source of audio to transcribe
options	Object	Parameters to filter requests. See below.
You can pass a Buffer or URL to a file to transcribe. Here's how to construct each:

Sending a URL
Python

source = {'url': URL_TO_AUDIO_FILE}
Sending a Buffer
Open a file and send the buffer returned.

Threaded
Async

with open(PATH_TO_FILE, 'rb') as audio:
  source = {'buffer': audio}
Pre-recorded Transcription Options
Additional transcription options can be provided for pre-recorded transcriptions. They are provided as an object as the second parameter of the transcription.prerecorded function. Each of these parameters maps to a feature in the Deepgram API. Reference the features documentation to learn the appropriate features for your request.

Pre-recorded Transcription Example Request
With the source you chose above, call the transcription function and provide any additional options as an object.

### Threaded

try:
    # STEP 1 Create a Deepgram client using the DEEPGRAM_API_KEY from environment variables
    deepgram = DeepgramClient()

    # STEP 2 Call the transcribe_url method on the prerecorded class
    options = PrerecordedOptions(
        model="nova-2",
        smart_format=True,
        summarize="v2",
    )
    url_response = deepgram.listen.rest.v("1").transcribe_url(
        AUDIO_URL, options
    )
    print(url_response)

except Exception as e:
    print(f"Exception: {e}")
Increasing the Timeout for Processing Larger Files
You might need to increase the default HTTP Timeout setting for larger files. The example increases the time to 300 seconds (or 5 mins).

this will increase the timeout to 300 seconds or 5 minutes
response = deepgram.listen.rest.v("1").transcribe_file(
  payload, options, timeout=httpx.Timeout(300.0, connect=10.0)
)

### Async
try:
    # STEP 1 Create a Deepgram client using the DEEPGRAM_API_KEY from environment variables
    deepgram = DeepgramClient()

    # STEP 2 Call the transcribe_url method on the prerecorded class
    options = PrerecordedOptions(
        model="nova-2",
        smart_format=True,
        summarize="v2",
    )
    url_response = await deepgram.listen.asyncrest.v("1").transcribe_url(
        AUDIO_URL, options
    )
    print(url_response)

except Exception as e:
    print(f"Exception: {e}")

this will increase the timeout to 300 seconds or 5 minutes
response = await deepgram.listen.asyncrest.v("1").transcribe_file(
  payload, options, timeout=httpx.Timeout(300.0, connect=10.0)
)

Where To Find Additional Examples
The SDK repository has a good collection of live audio transcription examples. The README contains links to them. Each example below attempts to provide different options for transcribing an audio source.

Some Examples

Threaded Client using an Audio File - examples/speech-to-text/rest/file
Threaded Client from a URL - examples/speech-to-text/rest/url
If the Async Client suits your use case better:

Async Client from a URL - examples/speech-to-text/rest/async_url
